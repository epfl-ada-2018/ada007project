Team members: Liang Yueran, Luo Yaxiong, Xia Shengzhao

# Abstract
Improving health condition is an indispensable part of society improvement. In this project, we focus on the Amazon product data to draw a conclusion on how to promote health. Our goal is to analyze the popularity of products related to physical health from different points of views, such as providing a visualization of data to show the changing trend of amount of reviews,  comparing average rating of the products. We hope to give people an insight of how these products influence peopleâ€™s life. Are they becoming more and more important or are they losing the interest of these kinds of products?  Morever, good recommendations are essential to promote these products for people interested in them. By combining rating, sentiment analysis of the review and other useful features of data, we also want to make a reasonable recommendations.

# Research questions

* How to define the popularity of healthy product specifically?

* What's the most popular Healthy product? How the average of rating varies between different categories?

* How the ratings of healthy product change and how people rate for different healthy products?

* what are the keywords in review for several popular healthy products?

* How to combine the serveral features of data to give recommendations (based on the ratings, based on the review) ?

### Category 

We will mainly concern several category listed below:
* Category information
    * Sports and Outdoors
    * Health and Personal Care

### Dataset Structure/Format

* Review Dataset

    * reviewerName - name of the reviewer
    * helpful - helpfulness rating of the review, e.g. 2/3
